# Michael-Games-AARPG-tutorial

This repository is my product of following Michael Games' tutorial on YouTube. Without having any real other knowledge in game design, I still felt that Michael had done a great job in decoupling the code, making it a great template for future games. This is why I will be sharing it here for anyone else who wants a template for a top-down 2D game.
All credit goes to Michael Games, which can be found on YouTube under the same name, or by following this link: https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelGamesOfficial

The repository is not an exact copy of Michael's tutorial, as I have taken some liberties, but it is very close to being an exact copy with only minor changes.

I hope this helps you, and thanks once again, Michael, for letting me learn game development from you!
